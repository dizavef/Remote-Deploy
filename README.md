# Remote-Deploy

Remote Disk tools

Currently at work there are a lot of systems with low space. This is because the systems are old and someone cheaped out and purchased a bunch of 128GB SSD's for company laptops. Now I'm the guy that get's to clone them to new HHDs and stay late a few times a week.


Required Tools
1. psexec.exe for remote code exec (duh)
2. windirstat.exe (I found it was faster to use windirstat and use the full unc pach).
